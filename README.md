# Everything you need to know to become AWS AI Practitioner

This repo is a study guide for the **[AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)** exam. It also covers how common AI and generative AI ideas show up on AWS in real projects.

The material follows the **official exam guide** ([PDF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/aws-certification/latest/ai-practitioner-01/ai-practitioner-01.pdf), [HTML hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-certification/latest/ai-practitioner-01.html)). For exam scope, service names, and domain weights, rely on AWS docs and the guide; both can change.

## Who this is for

- Professionals who need **foundational AI/ML and generative AI literacy** on AWS.
- Candidates preparing for **AIF-C01** who want domain-by-domain coverage plus hands-on examples.
- Anyone mapping **business problems** to the right AWS AI building blocks (without assuming you will train models from scratch).

The exam’s **target candidate** uses AI/ML on AWS but is **not** expected to implement deep model engineering, heavy MLOps pipelines, or organization-wide governance frameworks. On the exam those topics show up as _concepts_ to recognize, not as tasks to perform.

## Exam snapshot (official basics)

| Item                 | Detail                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exam code**        | AIF-C01                                                           |
| **Level**            | Foundational (AWS Certification)                                  |
| **Question types**   | Multiple choice, multiple response, ordering, matching            |
| **Scored questions** | 50 (plus **15 unscored** questions that do not affect your score) |
| **Passing score**    | **700** on a scaled score of 100–1000                             |
| **Scoring model**    | Compensatory (overall pass; section weights differ)               |

**Recommended knowledge (from AWS):** familiarity with core AWS services (for example EC2, S3, Lambda, **Amazon Bedrock**, **Amazon SageMaker AI**), the **shared responsibility model**, **IAM**, and **pricing models**. Up to about **six months**’ exposure to AI/ML on AWS is typical for the target candidate.

**Out-of-scope job tasks (examples from AWS):** developing model algorithms, heavy feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, building full AI/ML pipelines or security/compliance programs. On the exam you need to recognize _what_ these are, not perform them at expert depth.

## How to use this repo

1. **Read the domain guides in order** (1 through 5). Later domains assume vocabulary from earlier ones.
2. **Cross-link to AWS docs** for anything operational (IAM, encryption, regional availability, pricing).
3. **Run the code examples** under `examples/` to connect API shapes to the concepts (Bedrock, boto3 patterns, evaluation and monitoring ideas).
4. **Validate exam scope** using the official [in-scope services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-certification/latest/ai-practitioner-01/aif-01-in-scope-services.html) list.

| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Vocabulary & lifecycle | Domain 1 guide; sketch one ML lifecycle for a business problem you know.                    |
| **2** | GenAI building blocks  | Domain 2 guide; list 3 GenAI use cases and 2 failure modes (hallucination, cost).           |
